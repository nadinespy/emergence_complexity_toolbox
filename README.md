# Emergence & Complexity Toolbox

This will be the repository for a Python library that allows to call and apply several measures of emergence and complexity to either empirical or simulated time-series data, and provide guidance for comparisons among and conclusions about different measures. 

I work with yet unpublished software which is why I currently can't work publicly on this library. This will hopefully change in the near future.

# General idea

Measures of complexity operationalize the idea that a system of interconnected parts is both segregated (i.e., parts act independently), and integrated (i.e., parts show unified behaviour). Emergence, on the other hand, is a phenomenon in which a property occurs only in a collection of elements, but not in the individual elements themselves. Both emergence and complexity are promising concepts in the study of the brain (with a close relationship between the two).

Quantifications thereof can take on very different flavours, and there is no one-size-fits-all way to do it. While a plethora of complexity measures have been investigated quite substantially in the last couple of decades (see, e. g., [Wiesner, 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13243.pdf) for an overview), quantifying emergence is completely new territory. A few measures exist (see, e. g., [dynamical independence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06511.pdf), or [causal emergence](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008289), but they are not readily implementable - they are scattered over different github repositories (or people, if repositories are not existent), and programming languages (including Matlab which is not open source).

A way to easily use & compare a set of state of the art emergence and complexity measures - in an educated way, using only a few lines of code - is thus missing. This is the gap that Iâ€™d like to fill.

This library will be useful for anyone interested in micro-macro relationships using time-series data.

# Installation

# Examples 

# Citing

# Contribute

Once I have succeeded in releasing a mini-version of the library, I welcome contributions especially from people with software engineering/coding skills, and/or knowledge in information theory & complex systems, and/or a general interest in mathematical/formal micro-macro relationships, and/or a combination of the things just mentioned. Generally, contributions from anyone at any career stage and with any amount of coding experience will be welcome. Both contribution guidelines and Contributor Code of Conduct will be provided once a first release is achieved.
